<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
In a system that has three main models; Product, Ingredient, and Order.
A Burger (Product) may have several ingredients:
- 150g Beef
- 30g Cheese
- 20g Onion

The system keeps the stock of each of these ingredients stored in the database. You
can use the following levels for seeding the database:
- 20kg Beef
- 5kg Cheese
- 1kg Onion

When a customer makes an order that includes a Burger. The system needs to update the
stock of each of the ingredients so it reflects the amounts consumed.
Also when any of the ingredients stock level reaches 50%, the system should send an
email message to alert the merchant they need to buy more of this ingredient.
